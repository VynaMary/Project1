            <p>The Grant Memorial gold dollar and silver half dollar were struck by the United States Bureau of the Mint
                in 1922 in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Ulysses S. Grant, a leading Union general
                during the Civil War and later the 18th president of the United States. The two coins are identical in
                design and were sculpted by Laura Gardin Fraser. </p>

            <p>The Ulysses S. Grant Centenary Memorial Association wanted to sell 200,000 gold dollars to pay for
                projects in the areas of Grant's birthplace and boyhood home. Congress authorized 250,000 half dollars,
                but only 10,000 gold dollars. About 5,000 of each denomination were struck with a special mark, a star
                (example pictured). All of the gold dollars and most of the half dollars sold. The half dollar with star
                has long been priced higher than most commemoratives; its rarity has also caused it to be counterfeited.
                Money from the coins was used to help preserve Grant's birthplace, but other planned projects were not
                completed. (Full article...)</p>
